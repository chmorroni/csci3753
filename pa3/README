  Build - builds program
  Clean - cleans program

Run program:
   ./multi-lookup <# requesters> <# resolvers> <requester log> <resolver log> <data file> [<data file> ...]
   
   The file names specified by <data file> are passed to the pool of requester threads which place information 
   into a shared data area. Resolver threads read the shared data area and find the corresponding IP address.
   
   <# requesters> number of requester threads to place into the thread pool.
   <# resolvers> number of resolver threads to place into the thread pool.
   <requester log> name of the file into which all the requester status information is written.
   <resolver log> name of the file into which all the resolver status information is written.
   <data file> file(s) that are to be processed. Each file contains a list of host names, one per line,
               that are to be resolved.
